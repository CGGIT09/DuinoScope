This file describes the subset of the LX-200 protocol used by this project. This implementation will be fairly minimal, as most of the interfacing is handled on the ardunio itself.
All elements below are copied from the datasheet at https://www.meade.com/support/LX200CommandSet.pdf.
Any commands that are depenent on precision will be used in high precision mode. 
:SdsDD*MM#
    Set target object declination to sDD*MM or sDD*MM:SS depending on the current precision setting
    Returns:
    1 - Dec Accepted
    0 – Dec invalid 
:GD# Get Telescope Declination.
    Returns: sDD*MM# or sDD*MM’SS#
    Depending upon the current precision setting for the telescope.
